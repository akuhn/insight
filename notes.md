# Data Product

> The idea for my data product was born on Monday. I was in San Francisco, for the first day, and did not know where to go. And when I read lonely planet I was like, that a year's worth of places to see, I'd rather just have an outline for one day. Like something feasible with expected visiting and walking times. Like the kind of email my personal assistant would send me after having ask my local friends for cool things to see.

Names

- "Visit Vancouver"
- "Serendipity Engine"

Data sources

- Ideal would be tracking data from mobile phones so I'd know where people walked along and how long did it take them.
- Flicker photos might be a good proxy (see Eric Fischer's beautiful "Locals and Tourists" data art work)
- There seems to be a Yahoo research paper on extracting itineraries from flicker photos (via Monica)
- Other data sources are, yelp, expedia, wikitravel, foursquare.

Observations

- Downloaded data for Vancouver. Need to go day by day due to API glitch.
- Time zones are a pain, :datetaken has no timezone attached and seems to assume the users local timezone of where he lives, which for tourists is not vancouver! (assuming that it is consistent for single users)
- Single users can skew the data, for example there is this one guy who takes pictures of his bike ride to work, every morning! 
- Events might skew the data, like the olympics in Vancouver in 2010.
- Need to decide for each user whether they are local or a tourist.
